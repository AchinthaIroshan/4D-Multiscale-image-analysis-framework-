# 4D Multiscale Image Analysis framework to characterize 3D printed scaffolds using Micro-CT imaging
This image analysis framework was developed to characterize 3D-printed bioactive and hybrid scaffolds using micro-CT. The proposed framework facilitates micro-CT image preprocessing, image segmentation, classification, Volume of Interest (VOI) detection, VOI tracking, and quantitative analysis components.
