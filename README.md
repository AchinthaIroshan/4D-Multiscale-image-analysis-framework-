# Sintering
Image Analysis Framework to follow sintering of porous bioceramics in 4D


The Image Analysis Framework facilitate analysing sintering of 3D printed porous bioceramics using in-situ 4D imaging. 
The framework include preprocessing, Tracking Volumes of Interests(VOIs), Segmentation and quantitative analysis.
